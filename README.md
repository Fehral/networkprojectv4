Collapsed Core Architecture  
  * a two-tiered network design that combines the core and distribution layers into a single layer
  * more cost-effective than a three-tiered design with dedicated core, distribution, and access layers
  * not as scalable as three-tiered architectures and provides less redundancy

RIPv2  
  * Routing Information Protocol uses hop counts to determine the best path between routers using distance vectors
  * RIP version 2 is an improvement over version 1 by way of utilizing classless routing, support for variable length subnet masks, and authentication
    * VLSM allows for creation of subnets of varying sizes, optimizing IPv4 address usage
  * RIPv2 uses multicast for updates, reducing network bandwidth usage, while RIPv1 uses broadcasts
